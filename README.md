# CS426_Ablang_Eric_Asgn5

The new design I wanted to implement was that the human was stuck in room where they must complete tasks while being harrased by the cat. The red flickering lights I added were to replicate the inside of a computer where its dark and if theres errors, red lights should blink and some sort of eletricity sound should be present. I also implemented the cats "secret" room where a billboard lies with a video of a cat playing on it. There is also a particle system there to replicate some fog to set the mood of an "evil" lair. The balls I added replicate the balls the cat likes to play with and have a bouncy physics material on it. There are also sound clips attached to some objects and pressure pads of cat meowing, cat scream, and a computer thinking sound. Once of the pressure pads are triggered, the green light that is flickering stays on and begins playing the computer thinking sound. The sound of a cat screaming is played when the player enters the "evil" cat lair.
